Comparison of the performance of XS vs FFI zeromq bindings.  For FFI the
ZMQ::FFI bindings are used, first using FFI::Raw on the backend and then using
FFI::Platypus.  For XS ZMQ::LibZMQ3 is used.

Comparison is done using the zeromq weather station example, first by simply
timing wuclient.pl using the various implementations, and then by profiling
wuserver.pl using Devel::NYTProf.  When profiling the server is changed to
simply publish 1 million messages and exit. 

Example code was lightly optimized (e.g. don't do assignments in loop) and
modified to be more consistent.
