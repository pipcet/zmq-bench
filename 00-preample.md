### Ã˜MQ Perl Performance Comparison: FFI vs XS bindings ###

Comparison of the performance of FFI vs XS zeromq bindings.  For FFI the
`ZMQ::FFI` bindings are used, first using `FFI::Raw` on the backend and then
using `FFI::Platypus`.  For XS `ZMQ::LibZMQ3` is used.

Comparison is done using the zeromq weather station example, first by timing
wuclient.pl using the various implementations, and then by profiling
wuserver.pl using `Devel::NYTProf`.  When profiling the server is changed to
simply publish 1 million messages and exit.

Weather station example code was lightly optimized (e.g. don't declare vars in
loop) and modified to be more consistent.

Additionally, a more direct benchmark and comparison of `FFI::Platypus` vs XS
xsubs is also done.

C and Python implementation results are also provided as a baseline for
performance.

All the code that was created or modified for these benchmarks is listed at
the end (C/Python wuclient/wuserver code can be found in the [zmq guide](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#toc13)).
